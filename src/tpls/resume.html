	I've always liked building things. First it was with with Legos, then a backyard mini-golf course (my parent's loved the holes in the lawn), and eventually a full-scale trebuchet in high school. As a kid, I really didn't have much money, so my options were always limited. However, the day my family purchased its first PC, I found myself immersed in a whole new exciting and captivating virtual world, and the same curiosity and motivation to build physics things, now had a virtual space to work in. Without the burden of having to buy materials or expensive equipment, I could now build anything I wanted. Since a twenty line program costs the same as a 20k line program, I no longer had to worry about prices, and if I messed up, there were no materials to go out and buy again. The only thing I could lose was time, and even then I still gained experience from the failure.
	<br/><br/>
	Today I still hold the same passion for programming that I did as a kid. Except now I'm able to make a living out of it, and I've been fortunate to have made my passion into my profession.
